      <description>I recently switched back to using vim as my full time editor after using VS Code for a few years. I always did like Vim (I used an extension in VS Code to get vim keybindings), but I felt like I was missing a few productivity features, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t willing to put the time into setting Vim up properly. Now I see that it is definitely worth the effort.
One thing I missed from VS Code was the live-reload extension, which is indespensible when doing front-end development.</description>
