Canopy Mate is an automated cannabis grow tent. I designed the PCB for it, and collaborated on the firmware and app development.
My favourite part of that project though, was this test-jig I made. I designed and 3d printed the housing, which includes an array of pogo-pins that align with test pads I designed in to the PCB. The pogo pins connect to opto-isolated inputs on a Raspberry Pi 4 which runs the testing software.</description></item></channel></rss>
